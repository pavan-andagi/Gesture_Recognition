# Gesture_Recognition
## Steps in the complete project
   ### number of images to be taken per video/sequence
   ### cropping the images
   ### resizing the images
   ### normalizing the images

In this project, you will build a model to recognise 5 hand gestures. The starter code has been shared with you above. Before you start working on the mode, let's see the suggestions Snehansu has to finish the project successfully.


### You need to accomplish the following in the project:

### Generator:  
    The generator should be able to take a batch of videos as input without any error. Steps like cropping, resizing and normalization should be performed successfully.

### Model: 
    Develop a model that is able to train without any errors which will be judged on the total number of parameters (as the inference(prediction) time should be less) and the accuracy achieved. As suggested by Snehansu, start training on a small amount of data and then proceed further.

### Write up: 
    This should contain the detailed procedure followed in choosing the final model. The write up should start with the reason for choosing the base model, then highlight the reasons and metrics taken into consideration to modify and experiment to arrive at the final model.
